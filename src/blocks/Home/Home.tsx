          Hello, I am Omotayo but people call me "Omotee". I am passionate abou
          solving problems faced by the society using the best technologies. I
          love paying attention to details. One of the things that makes me
          excited is seeing ideas come to life.
          <br />
          <br />
          When I{"’"}m not writing code, I{"’"}m usually going to the gym,
          playing with Luna or hanging out with my friends and family, or
          watching my favourite shows.
